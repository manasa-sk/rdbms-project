We have decided to build a database management system. Users will
have the power to manage their data.The
syntax weâ€™re gonna use will be simple switch statement and the plan is to
integrate storing media files of png/jpeg/gif formats as well. The primary
data structures we decided to use are vectors, linked lists and Bplus trees. We
might use more data structures (within what is allowed) if we come up with
any extra features to implement. The following is a list of functions that our
prototype would have :

Basic Statements:
  create
  select
  insert
  delete
  update
  
Data types that can be stored :
  Integer
  Double
  String
  Char
  
Features:
  Detects duplicate table names (primary indexing)
  Login feature for users (not yet implemented)
  hashing for efficient data retrieval
  Keys such as primary, foreign, super, candidate (not yet implemented)
